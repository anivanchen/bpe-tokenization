# Byte-Pair Encoding Tokenization

Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is an efficient tokenization technique used to segment text into subword units. It iteratively merges the most frequent pair of adjacent bytes until no further merges are possible, an iteration limit has been reached, or a desired vocabulary size has been reached. This results in a set of unique tokens. The BPE approach has been shown to outperform other tokenization methods in certain NLP tasks like language modeling and machine translation.
